# [Project 1: Driver Distraction Detection using Convolutional Neural Nets.](https://github.com/android-kunjapppan/Distracted-Driver-Detection-using-CNN/blob/master/Maheer_report.pdf)
<p>Distracted Driving is the major cause for several road accidents. According to the survey of the NHTSA, one among five motor vehicle crashes is due to driver distraction. To overcome this, our aim is to develop an accurate and robust system for detecting a distracted driver. In previous works, Transfer learning models like AlexNet, GoogleNet and ResNet have been used. To train the model, State Farm Driver Distraction Dataset has been used in which the actions of drivers are classified into ten categories. In the proposed work, a model from scratch is developed and trained on our dataset. Then the same AlexNet, GoogleNet, ResNet models have been used by doing Fine-Tuning and adding some extra layers to these models. Next other state-of-the-art models like Xception, VGG16, MOBILENET and ResNet50 are trained with our dataset by adding extra layers to these models and then Fine-Tuned the model. Finally, ensembled all the models to attain better accuracy and tested it on our test data. Our experimental results indicate the attainment of better accuracy.</p>
